# 🌊 Mini Waterways

A minimalist, strategy-based boat management game inspired by *Mini Metro* and *Mini Motorways*, built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas.

Design and manage efficient water routes across islands, ports, and cities using ferries, barges, and more — all while navigating environmental challenges, logistics, and sustainable energy use.

> 🚀 Created for an IT conference with a focus on **water and energy**, Mini Waterways explores clean transport, resource delivery, and modern urban challenges... through boats.

- 🚤 **Basic AI boat movement**  
- 💧 Clean, minimalist art style  
- 🎯 Interactive canvas built with TypeScript  

### Coming Soon

- 🌧️ Weather & tide mechanics  
- ⚡ Integration with energy generation (hydro/tidal)  
- 📦 Resource & passenger delivery  
- ♻️ Sustainability and efficiency scoring
